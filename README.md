# LeetCode Practice
This is a project I put together to test myself using [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/), as well as testing the speed of various different solutions so that I can learn more about Python capabilities and limitations.

I'm following the [NeetCode](https://neetcode.io) practice list, but will occasionally revisit LeetCode directly.

## Usage
To test an individual challenge, run:
```
poetry run pytest -k test_1234
```

Note that all solutions for a challenge are tested at the same time. Easy challenges have quite a few versions due to the ease at which they can be written, whereas I am more likely to just refine one or two versions for harder challenges.
